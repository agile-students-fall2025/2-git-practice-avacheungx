### [New VMSApe Attack Breaks Guest-Host Isolation on AMD, Intel CPUs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-vmscape-attack-breaks-guest-host-isolation-on-amd-intel-cpus/?utm_source=tldrinfosec)

> **Why is this important?**
>
> - **Security Impact:** This article discusses a newly discovered vulnerability called "VMSApe" that allows attackers to break the isolation between virtual machines and their host systems on both AMD and Intel CPUs. This is a big deal for cloud providers and anyone using virtualization for security.
> - **Real-World Relevance:** Many organizations rely on virtualization for secure environments. If attackers can escape from a VM, they could potentially access sensitive data or compromise the host system.
> - **Cutting-Edge Research:** The attack highlights ongoing challenges in hardware and software security, showing that even widely used technologies can have critical flaws.
>
> I found this article interesting because it demonstrates how attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass security boundaries we rely on. Itâ€™s a reminder to stay updated on security news and to patch systems regularly.
